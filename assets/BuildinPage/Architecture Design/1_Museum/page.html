      The Coming-of-Age Ceremony Museum.<br><br>

      Type: Personal Project<br>
      Background: Rituals and ceremonies have always been an essential part of our lives, whether motivated by religion, 
      mythology, or political intent. In traditional societies dominated by myth, religion, and rituals, these practices 
      not only helped us comprehend the laws of the physical world but also guided the development of our spiritual world. 
      A prime example is the coming-of-age ceremony. As adolescents grow older, they encounter crises in the world that 
      seem insurmountable. Coming-of-age ceremonies across various cultures are designed to transition young individuals, 
      both physically and especially psychologically, into adulthood. Through these rites of passage, they gain the ability 
      to face challenges and symbolically sever ties with their past selves.<br><br>

      In contemporary society, scientific systems have replaced traditional mythology and religion, providing an unprecedentedly 
      comprehensive understanding of the physical world. However, this has also led to a sense of spiritual disorientation on 
      a societal level. The global rise in suicide rates and the prevalence of depression year after year reflect the painful 
      transition from the structured order of traditional societies to the multifaceted freedom of modern society. This proposal 
      does not aim to restore the traditional order to modern reality but seeks to commemorate and reflect on it.<br>
