      Background: <br>
      The internet and electronic devices are gradually replacing print media as the primary means for people to access 
      information. Meanwhile, the influence of physical architectural spaces and the sensory experiences they convey has diminished.
      As information exchange and knowledge interaction increasingly occur in the digital realm, a disconnect has emerged in how 
      people navigate life between the physical and virtual worlds.<br><br>

      Method: <br>
      The influence of the medium's form surpasses that of its content, quoted from McLuhan. The formal characteristics of 
      a medium, when repeatedly manifested under different artificial environments and material conditions, constitute its greatest 
      social impact. This influence does not operate at the level of consciousness and ideas but rather at the subconscious level, 
      shaping sensory proportions and types of perception.<br>
      This project aims to design a spatial medium that goes beyond serving as a space for accessing digital or textual information. 
      Instead, it becomes a new form of "information" that can be read in its own right. Through engaging with this novel informational 
      medium, people do not acquire traditional knowledge but rather a conceptual understanding of spatial functionality, a redefined 
      perception of space, and an exploration of the boundaries of their own cognitive activities.<br>
